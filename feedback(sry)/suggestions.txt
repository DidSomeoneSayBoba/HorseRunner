Possibly utilize acceleration instead of the standard movement of 1 m per key
Possible acceleration formula: k(1 + 1/cn)^cn
(1 + 1/n)^n approaches e, 2.718
c and k are constants that basically modify how much and how fast the acceleration do its thing
 n = rhythm streak
b.(see image)
If you donâ€™t want acceleration, potentially make the increments less than 1m; 1m movement may look somewhat jank on the screen
